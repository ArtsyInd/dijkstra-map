# dijkstra-map
Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path on a map.

Project Details
Maps - Map is taken/exported from OpenStreetMap while is a free and open service to use.
The file exported is in .osm format which is used in the program.

Algorithm - For Shortest Path we are using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
The connection between nodes are stored in a Nodes x Nodes adjacency Matrix.
